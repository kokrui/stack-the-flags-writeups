# Mobile Challenges

Although we did solve a few mobile challenges it was mostly because the apk file wasn't obfuscated properly and we could get the flags by checking the strings in the C library.
Other players could continue with the challenges by patching the apk file to bypass the flag checks and getting the flags immediately.
Will do better next time.
